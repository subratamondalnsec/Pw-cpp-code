/*
You are tasked with Implementing a simple number guessing game in C++ involving a Guesser, 
three Players, and an Umpire. The game operates as follows:

Guesser: This entity will guess a number.

Players: Each of the three players will guess a number. 3 players p1-2 p2->4 p3->2

Umpire: This entity will collect the guesses from the Guesser and the Players and determine which Players, if any, have guessed the same number as the Guesser.

p1->2 p2->4 p3->2

x -> 4

p1 lost the game

p2 won the game
